## Welcome!

Thanks for visiting my site!  You're looking at a best effort replica of the 
JetBrains IDE [Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/).  I love webstorm and
highly recommend you try it out.  

## Why?

The idea to build an homage to Webstorm struck me while trying to decide what to do with my
old personal webpage.  It was based on a bootstrap theme and, while it looked nice, it felt very
boring and definitely didn't show off my capabilities.  Once the idea hit, I couldnt' stop thinking
about it.
